# Stock Broker Landing Page (HTML + CSS)

A modern, professional, eye-catching stock broker landing page built with **pure HTML and CSS** and filled with **mock data** (quotes, team, pricing, testimonials) for design/demo purposes.

## Preview / Run

- Open `index.html` in a browser.
- From PowerShell (Windows): `start index.html`

## What’s Included

- Sticky header + navigation + mobile menu (no JavaScript; uses `<details>`).
- Hero section with a “market snapshot” card (mock data).
- Featured-in strip, stats, and feature cards (SVG icons).
- Broker team cards (mock profiles).
- Testimonials (mock).
- Pricing plans (mock).
- FAQ accordion (pure HTML `<details>`).
- Responsive layout + reduced-motion support.

## Customize

- Branding and copy: edit `index.html`.
- Colors, spacing, layout: edit CSS variables in `style.css` under `:root`.
- Fonts: the page uses Inter via Google Fonts; remove the `<link>` tags in `index.html` to go fully offline.

## Files

- `index.html` — page structure/content
- `style.css` — styling/theme

## Note

This project is a **design demo**. It is **not** a real brokerage product and **not financial advice**.
